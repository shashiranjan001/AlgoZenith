Description

You have given an array A of size N and a positive integer K (≤ N). A1, A2, ..., AN are the elements of the array.
Let Bi = max (Ai, Ai+1, ..., Ai+K-1), for 1 ≤ i ≤ N - K + 1. 
Find Bi values for all is such that 1 ≤ i ≤ N - K + 1.


Input Format

The first line contains T, the number of test cases. 
The first line of each test case contains N, the number of integers in an array A and K.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN.


Output Format

For each test case, print array B as B1 B2 ... BN-K+1 in a new line.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100000
1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 100000
-109 ≤ Ai ≤ 109
Sum of N over all test cases ≤ 5 * 10^5.

Description

Find the number of binary strings of length n where “0100” is not present as a substring.


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer t - the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n.


Output Format

For each test case, print the number of binary strings of length n where “0100” is not present as a substring mod 10^9+7.


Constraints

1 ≤ t ≤ 106

1 ≤ n ≤ 106 where n is the length of the string.

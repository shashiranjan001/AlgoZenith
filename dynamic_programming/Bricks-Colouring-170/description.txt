Description

You are given N bricks in a line and M different coloured buckets of paint. You have to find the number of ways you can colour the brick wall such that there are exactly K positions out of the N bricks such that it has a different colour from the brick wall on its immediate left. (except the first brick, since there is no left brick). Print it modulo 10^9+7.

 

 


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer T - the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

The first and only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, M, K.

 


Output Format

For each test case, print the number of ways you can color the brick wall satisfying the given condition % 10^9+7.


Constraints

1≤ T ≤ 100

1≤ N, M ≤ 2000

0≤ K ≤ N-1

It is guaranteed that the sum of NK over all test cases does not exceed 4108.

Consider a money system consisting of N coins. Each coinhas a positive integer value. Your taks is to produce a sum of money X using the available coins
in such a way that the number of coins is minimal.

For example, if the coins are {1,5,7} and the desired sum is 11, an optimal solution is 5+5+1 which requires 3 coins.

First line of input contains number N and sume S

second line contain the N coins space seperated

Print out the optimal solution

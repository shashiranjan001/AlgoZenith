Description

Given a grid of size n*m, you need to find the total number of different paths from (1, 1) to (n, m). You are allowed to move from (x, y) to (x+1, y) and (x, y) to (x, y+1). The grid may have some blocked cells, represented by 1, and it is not allowed to move to a blocked cell. An empty cell is represented by 0. You are also given an integer k and you can convert at most k blocked cells into unblocked cells.


Input Format

The first line of the input contains one integer t - the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers n, m, k - the size of the grid and the number of cells you can convert.

Each of the following n lines contains m space-separated integers, aij - the number at that cell.


Output Format

For each test case, print the number of paths modulo 10^9 + 7.


Constraints

1 ≤ t ≤ 105

1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200

0 ≤ k ≤ 400

0 ≤ aij ≤ 1

It is guaranteed that the sum of nmk over all test cases does not exceed 108.

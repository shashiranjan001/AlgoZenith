Description

You have given an array of length N, and a number X. Find the number of subsets with the sum of elements less than equal to X.

Note:

The sum of elements in an empty subset is 0.
The set may contain duplicates elements.

Input Format

The first line of input contains T - the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated numbers N and X.
The second line of each test case contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN.  


Output Format

Print the number of subsets with a sum less than equal to X in a new line for each test case.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 5
1 ≤ N ≤ 35
0 ≤ Ai ≤ 104
0 ≤ X ≤ 106

Description

You have given two positive integers n and k. Your task is to print all balanced parenthesis of length n in lexicographic order (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_order) with depth exactly k. 

Balanced parentheses mean that each opening symbol has a corresponding closing symbol and the pairs of parentheses are properly nested.

Note:

depth("") = 0.
depth('(' + A + ')) = depth(A) + 1, where A is a balanced paranthesis sequence.
depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B)), where A and B are both balanced paranthesis sequence.
depth("(") = depth(")") = 0

Input Format

The only line of input contains two numbers number n and k.


Output Format

Print all balanced parenthesis of length n with depth k in lexicographic order.


Constraints

2 ≤ n ≤ 24
1 ≤ k ≤ n / 2
It is guaranteed that n is an even number.

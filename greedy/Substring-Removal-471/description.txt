Description

You are given a string s and two integers x and y. You can perform two types of operations any number of times.

Remove substring "ab" and gain x points.

For example, when removing "ab" from "cabxbae" it becomes "cxbae".

Remove substring "ba" and gain y points.

For example, when removing "ba" from "cabxbae" it becomes "cabxe".

Return the maximum points you can gain after applying the above operations on s.


Input Format

The first line contains an integer T (number of test cases), 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5.

The next T lines contain a string S and 2 space-separated integers S, X, Y where 1 ≤ X,Y ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10^6.

Sum of |S| across all test cases ≤ 10^7.


Output Format

For each test case print the maximum point possible in a new line.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ X,Y ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 10^5.
Sum of |S| across all test cases ≤ 10^6.

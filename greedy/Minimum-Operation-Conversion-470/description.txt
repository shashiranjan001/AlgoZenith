Description

You are given a number X, you can perform two operations:

Double: Multiply the number on the display by 2, or;
Decrement: Subtract 1 from the number on the display.
Return the minimum number of operations needed to convert number X to Y.


Input Format

The first line contains an integer T (number of test cases), 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6.

The next T lines contain 2 space-separated integers X, Y where 1 ≤ X,Y ≤ 10^18.


Output Format

For each test case print the minimum number of operations required in a new line.


Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 10^6.
1 ≤ X,Y ≤ 10^18

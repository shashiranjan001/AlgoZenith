Description

You are given an array A of size N. In one operation you can select any non-decreasing subarray and increment all the elements in the subarray by one. Your goal is to make the whole array non-decreasing in minimum operations.

 


Input Format

First line of input contains T, number of test cases.

First line of each test case contains n.

Next line contains n integers of array A.

 


Output Format

For each test case print a single integer in a new line: Minimum number of operations.


Constraints

T ≤ 10

1 ≤ n ≤ 105

0 ≤ Ai ≤ 109

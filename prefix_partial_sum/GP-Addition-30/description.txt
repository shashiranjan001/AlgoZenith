Description

Given an array of N integers and Q queries and an integer K. Initially, all the elements of the array have value 0.

In each query 3 integers A, L, R is given, which means perform GP addition

Arr[L]+=A

Arr[L+1]+=AK

Arr[L+2]+=AKK

Arr[L+3]+=AKKK

.

.

.

.

Arr[R]+=A*(K^(R-L))

 

After performing all the operations. Print the final array % 10^9+7.


Input Format

The first line contains three space-separated integers N, Q, K where 1<=N<=10^6, 1<=Q<=10^6, 1<=K<=10^9.

Next Q lines contain three space-separated integers A, L, R where 0<=A<=10^4, 1<=L<=R<=N.


Output Format

Print the N space-separated integer representing the final array %10^9+7.

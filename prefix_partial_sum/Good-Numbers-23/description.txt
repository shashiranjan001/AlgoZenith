Description

There are N students and ith student likes all numbers in the range [li ,ri ], both inclusive. A number is good if it is liked by at least K students.

You are even Q queries. Each query consists of two numbers L, R. You have to find how many numbers in the range [L,R] is good.


Input Format

The first line of input contains three integers, N, K (1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 1000000), and Q (1 ≤ Q ≤ 1000000).

The next N lines contain two integers li and ri (1 ≤ li ≤ ri≤ 1000000), describing that the i-th student likes all the numbers [li,ri].

The next Q lines contain L and R, (1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 1000000).


Output Format

For each query print how many numbers in the range [L,R] is good in a new line.

Description

Given an array of N integers, find the number of subarrays with a sum less than equal to K.


Input Format

The first line contains T, the number of test cases (1<=T<=10).

The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N, K where 1<=N<=10^5, 0<=K<=10^9.

Next line contains N space-separated integers (0<=Ai<=1e4).


Output Format

For each test case print the number of subarrays with a sum less than K in a newline.

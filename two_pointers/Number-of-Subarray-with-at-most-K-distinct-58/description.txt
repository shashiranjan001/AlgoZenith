The first line contains T, the number of test cases (1<=T<=10).

The first line contains two space-separated integers N, K where 1<=N<=10^5, 0<=K<=10^5.

Next line contains N space-separated integers (0<=Ai<=1e6).


Output Format

For each test case print the number of subarrays with at most K distinct elements in a newline.

Description

You have given an array A of N elements. An Inversion Count of the array is defined as the number of pairs (i, j) such that Ai > Aj and i < j.
Find the Inversion Count in A.


Input Format

The first line of input contains one integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 105) — the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains N (2 ≤ N ≤ 105), the number of elements in an array A.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, …, AN, (0 ≤ Ai ≤ 109)
It is guaranteed that the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5 x 105.


Output Format

For each test case, print the answer on a new line denoting the Inversion Count.

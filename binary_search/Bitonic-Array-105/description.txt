Description

Given a bitonic array A consisting of N integers and an integer Q. In each query, you will be given an integer K, find the positions of K in A. Integer K exists in A.

Bitonic array - A bitonic sequence is a sequence with A[1]<A[2]<A[3]....A[k]>A[k+1]>A[k+2]....>A[N] for some 1<=K≤N. 


Input Format

The first line contains T, the number of test cases (1<=T<=10000).

The first line contains two space separated-integer N, Q where 1<=N<=10^5, 1<=Q<=10^6.

The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2....AN where -1e9<=Ai<=1e9.

Next Q lines contains an integer K, -1e9<=K<=1e9.

Sum of N, Q across all test case ≤10^6


Output Format

For each test case print the positions of K in A in sorted order in a new line.

Positions are 1-indexed.
